Clusteer is a Puppeteer wrapper written for PHP, with the super-power of parallelizing pages across multiple browser instances.

The package leverages [thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster), a Node.js module that allows you to build standby Puppeteer browsers that will open up pages,
making the process of using a browser a blazing-fast experience. ⚡
